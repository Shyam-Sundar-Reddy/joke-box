Welcome to Joke Box, a web application built using Node.js, HTML, EJS, Express, CSS,(SVG) and JavaScript. Joke Box is a fun way to share jokes with friends, family, and coworkers.

Joke Box allows users to search for jokes by topic, view joke collections, and create their own collections of jokes. Joke Box also includes a "Random Joke" feature to keep the laughter going.

Joke Box is powered by the Joke API, an open source API that provides access to thousands of jokes. The Joke API documentation can be found at https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/.

To get started with Joke Box, download the source code from GitHub and run npm install to install the dependencies. Then, run npm start to launch the app.

Thank you for trying out Joke Box. We hope you enjoy the laughs.
